//! Utilities for working with buffers.
//!
//! A buffer is any structure that contains a sequence of bytes. The bytes may
//! or may not be stored in contiguous memory. This module contains traits used
//! to abstract over buffers as well as utilities for working with buffer types.
//!
//! # `Buf`, `BufMut`
//!
//! These are the two foundational traits for abstractly working with buffers.
//! They can be thought as iterators for byte structures. They offer additional
//! performance over `Iterator` by providing an API optimized for byte slices.
//!
//! See [`Buf`] and [`BufMut`] for more details.
